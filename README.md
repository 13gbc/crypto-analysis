Cryptocurrencies, also known as digital or virtual currencies, are a form of decentralized, digital currency that uses cryptography for security. They operate independently of a central bank or government, and allow for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009, but since then many other cryptocurrencies have been created, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.

As I am learning about the cyber security impact of crypto, It's important to understand that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies also means that they are vulnerable to cyber attacks. This can include hacking of exchanges, wallets, and other platforms where cryptocurrencies are bought, sold, or stored. Additionally, the anonymity of transactions can also make it easier for criminals to launder money or engage in other illegal activities.
